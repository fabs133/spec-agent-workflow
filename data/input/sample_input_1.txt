Meeting Notes - Sprint Planning

We need to implement the following features:

1. User authentication with OAuth2
   - Support Google and GitHub login
   - Store tokens securely
   - Priority: HIGH

2. Dashboard redesign
   - Move sidebar to the left
   - Add dark mode toggle
   - Priority: MEDIUM

3. Bug: CSV export crashes when data contains special characters
   - Reported by: Customer Support
   - Priority: HIGH
   - Workaround: Remove special chars before export

Decision: We will use PostgreSQL instead of MySQL for the new microservice
because it has better JSON support and the team has more experience with it.
