Architecture Review Notes

Pattern: Repository Pattern
We should use the repository pattern for data access to decouple
business logic from database operations. This makes testing easier
since we can mock the repository in unit tests.

Task: Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Configure GitHub Actions for automated testing
- Add linting step (ruff)
- Deploy to staging on merge to main
- Estimated effort: 2 days

Note: The API rate limiting should be implemented at the gateway level,
not in individual services. This avoids duplication and ensures consistent
behavior across all endpoints.
